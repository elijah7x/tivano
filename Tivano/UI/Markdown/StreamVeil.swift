/// Streamed text arrives the way zeron draws it (`crates/ui/src/markdown/veil.rs`, itself a
/// port of mugen-markdown's `FadePainter`): every flush is committed to layout at once, and a
/// purely cosmetic veil over the characters that just arrived dissolves over the next beat.
/// Nothing moves and nothing resizes; a token that fades in exactly where it will stay is
/// what reads as text being written, where a token that popped in whole read as a glitch.
///
/// - Each append registers the new tail as a chunk with its arrival time. A fast stream
///   keeps several chunks fading at once (a rolling veil); a chunk fades exactly once, and
///   text already faded never animates again.
/// - The fade's length follows the stream's cadence: an EMA of the gaps between flushes,
///   `duration = clamp(ema × 3, 120ms, 400ms)`, so a fast stream dissolves quickly and a
///   slow one lingers. Three or more chunks in flight speed each other up by 30% a chunk.
/// - The dissolve eases as `(1 − p)^1.6`, so the text shows through at `1 − veil`.
/// - Only opacity changes, and only the paint: every consumer keeps its layout byte for byte.
/// - What is already on screen when a veil attaches (a row scrolled back into view, a thread
///   switched back to mid-reply) is adopted as the baseline and never fades; only later
///   appends do. A rewrite that is not an append (the parser re-deriving a block once
///   `**bold` closes) keeps the common prefix's fades and re-veils only the changed tail.
///
/// Offsets are in characters of the plain text the consumer hands over, so a SwiftUI
/// `AttributedString` and an AppKit text storage each map them into their own ranges.
