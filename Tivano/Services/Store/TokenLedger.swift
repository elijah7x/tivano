/// its history into a new file, so thousands of transcripts cost one seek each. Per-file fingerprints
/// (mtime plus size) keep later scans incremental. Files written after
/// launch are skipped because live recording already owns them; counting
/// both would double every active session.
///
/// Codex is the one provider whose usage is both observed live and read back
/// from disk, so it needs provenance. Live Codex spend is recorded under the
/// rollout identity — the Codex thread (or head) id, which is the session id
/// its rollout file is named for — and the spend of earlier processes is
/// reconciled against the scan by subtracting it from that identity's own
/// growth. That survives restarts, resumed threads (a new file sharing the
/// session id) and repeated scans: the subtraction is recomputed from the
/// fingerprints every time, never accumulated. Claude history is live-only for
/// now: its usage rows are scattered through gigabytes of JSONL, which is
/// not a Settings-open price worth paying.
